# Supabase Setup Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Database Schema Update Required

**You MUST run the database migration before the Dashboard and Analytics will display metrics correctly.**

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

1. **Go to your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the entire contents of `MIGRATION_SCHEMA.sql`**
4. **Click "Run" to execute the migration**

This migration will:
- ‚úÖ Add Worth Score fields to profiles table
- ‚úÖ Add enhanced tracking fields to trades table  
- ‚úÖ Create daily_stats and monthly_stats tables
- ‚úÖ Create behavioral_insights table
- ‚úÖ Add profile picture support
- ‚úÖ Create all necessary indexes and policies
- ‚úÖ Set up triggers for automatic calculations

**‚ö†Ô∏è Without this migration, you'll see:**
- Zero values in Dashboard metrics
- Empty charts and graphs
- No Worth Score calculation
- Missing profile features

### Step 2: Storage Setup for Profile Pictures

**The migration creates the bucket automatically, but you need to verify:**

1. **Check Storage Bucket:**
   - Go to Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Storage
   - Verify `profile-pictures` bucket exists and is public
   - If not created, manually create it with public access

2. **Storage Policies (Auto-created by migration):**
   The migration automatically creates these policies, but verify they exist:

   **Insert Policy:**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
     AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
   );
   ```

   **Select Policy:**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Profile pictures are publicly viewable" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'profile-pictures');
   ```

   **Update Policy:**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
   FOR UPDATE USING (
     bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
     AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
   );
   ```

   **Delete Policy:**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own profile pictures" ON storage.objects
   FOR DELETE USING (
     bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' 
     AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
   );
   ```

### Step 3: Google OAuth Setup

1. **Google Cloud Console Setup:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable Google+ API
   - Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: Web application
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Client Secret

2. **Supabase OAuth Setup:**
   - Go to Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Providers
   - Find Google and enable it
   - Enter your Google Client ID and Client Secret
   - Save configuration

## Worth Score Calculation

The Worth Score is calculated using a weighted average of 5 components:

1. **Win Rate Score (25%):** Based on win percentage (60%+ = 100 points)
2. **Timing Score (20%):** Based on average hold time (shorter is better for day trading)
3. **Discipline Score (25%):** Based on risk-reward ratio adherence
4. **Risk Management Score (15%):** Based on position sizing consistency
5. **Consistency Score (15%):** Based on P&L volatility (lower volatility = higher score)

The overall Worth Score ranges from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better trading behavior and discipline.
